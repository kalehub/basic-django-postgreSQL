# Basic Music CRUD App Built Using Django and PostgreSQL

The purpose of this project is to develop my understanding building web apps using Django (Python Framework) and PostgreSQL as my DB and server.

## Things That I Learn

From this projects I learn how to build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) apps using Django, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap 5. This small project is only the beginning, since I am looking forward to use more Django, PostgreSQL and maybe React to my future project (wish me luck!).
